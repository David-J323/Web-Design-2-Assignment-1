      <h1>Origins</h1>
      <p>Hive Fives was founded in 2017 by David John Niel who sought to bring new gamers together to support each other and make sure no one was left alone. What spurred the idea was the fact David and his own small circle of friends couldn't find enough people to form teams. The group is made up of casual and serious gamers who just love to play games and have fun.</p>

      <h1>Games We Play </h1>
      <p>The games we mainly play are Destiny 2, Rocket League, and Friday the 13th. We also play Gears of War, Halo, Division, and Titanfall 2, but tend to not play these so often. After the release of Destiny 2, Hive Fives has focused most (if not all) of its attention to the game. If you're interested in joining the group, message any one of the Admins for an invitation.</p>
